# spark-incremental
Some code and other material for exploring exact incremental updates in Spark

A presentation (composed with [Remark.js](http://remarkjs.com)) is here:
[Exact and approximate incremental updates for some machine learning models](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/robert-dodier/spark-incremental/blob/master/spark-incremental.html)

NOTE: Looks like document navigation isn't working; perhaps Javascript has been disabled by htmlpreview. I'll try to figure it out, but in the meantime, you can download the document and view it locally via `file:///...`. If you know how to get it working, maybe you can let me know.
